## Scratchpad: Notes on Code Snippet

**RichSpaceInterpolator Class:**

*   **Purpose:** Implements the core logic of the RichSpace paper's interpolation algorithms, adapted for HunyuanVideo. It primarily deals with calculating a "perpendicular foot" point in embedding space and finding an optimal interpolation point among the several available, via this projection technique.
*   **`calculate_perpendicular_foot` Method:**
    *   Calculates a perpendicular projection of a vector onto a direction while ensuring tensor dimensions remain compatible with HunyuanVideo's requirements.
    *   Takes three embedding tensors (`embed_a`, `embed_b`, `embed_guide`) of shape `[1, sequence_length, hidden_dim]`.
    *   Calculates vectors `vec_ac` (`embed_guide` - `embed_a`) and `vec_ab` (`embed_b` - `embed_a`).
    *   Computes the projection coefficient of `vec_ac` onto `vec_ab` efficiently by using a dot product for the numerator and squared norm for the denominator in that vector projection operation.
    *   Adds a small epsilon to the denominator to avoid division by zero.
    *   Calculates the projection vector (`proj_vec`).
    *   Calculates the foot point by adding `proj_vec` to `embed_a`.
    *   Returns the `foot_point` tensor with the same shape as the input embeddings, as well as data type and device placement as input embed_a.
*   **`find_optimal_interpolation` Method:**
    *   The goal is to find the interpolation between the initial embed and final embed that best matches the perpendicular foot (the projection) as defined in `calculate_perpendicular_foot`.
    *   Finds the optimal interpolation point in embedding space using the perpendicular foot technique while preserving correct tensor dimensions for use in HunyuanVideo.
    *   Takes six inputs: three embeddings and their corresponding attention masks, as well as the number of steps for interpolation. Shapes are defined in the docstrings.
    *   Calculates the perpendicular foot point using the `calculate_perpendicular_foot` method.
    *   Iterates `num_steps` times, performing linear interpolation between `embed_a` and `embed_b` (and their masks) at each step `t`.
    *   Applies the attention mask `interp_mask` to `interp_embed` element-wise.
    *   Applies `attention_mask_guide` to the `foot_point` in the same way.
    *   Calculates the cosine similarity between the flattened interpolated embedding and the flattened foot point (both masked) by normalizing each, viewing them into a flattened vector form of length `sequence_length * hidden_dim`, and then computing their cosine similarity with each other, preserving shape dimension `1`.
    *   Stores the similarity score and the interpolated embedding & mask in lists.
    *   Selects the index with the highest similarity as the optimal interpolation point and returns that result.

**HyVideoRichSpaceTextEncode Class:**

*   **Purpose:** This class appears to be designed as a node for ComfyUI, a graphical interface for Stable Diffusion workflows. It integrates the `RichSpaceInterpolator` into the HunyuanVideo text-to-video generation pipeline, making it readily usable in that workflow context.
*   **`INPUT_TYPES` Class Method:**
    *   Defines the expected inputs for the ComfyUI node.
    *   Requires a `text_encoders` object (presumably from HunyuanVideo), and three string prompts (`prompt_a`, `prompt_b`, `guide_prompt`).
    *   Optional parameters like prompt templates are provided to match how other nodes format prompt text for this text encoder, and clip_l is allowed for conditioning on other embed types in addition.
*   **`process` Method:**
    *   Implements the main logic of the ComfyUI node.
    *   Retrieves the appropriate device from an external `mm` module (unclear from the snippet).
    *   Gets the text encoder from the input dictionary, properly managing its movement between devices and fp8 autocasting.
    *   Handles prompt templates for format standardization by way of the get\_embedding\_with\_mask helper.
    *   The helper function:
        *   Uses a `get_embedding_with_mask` function to obtain the embedding and attention mask for each prompt from the text encoder. The function sets up the text inputs in a format that can be fed directly to the text encoder's internal modules.
    *   Creates an instance of `RichSpaceInterpolator`.
    *   Uses a `with torch.autocast(...)` block for mixed-precision computation.
    *   Calls `find_optimal_interpolation` on the interpolator to get the optimal embedding and mask.
    *   Handles optional CLIP embeddings from a given `clip_l` encoder and formats it appropriately.
    *   Constructs an `prompt_embeds_dict` in the format expected by HunyuanVideo. This dict format allows the conditioning mechanism to select between a standard prompt embed from the given model and optional embeds provided by the `clip_l` module.
    *   Returns the `prompt_embeds_dict`.

**Overall Observations:**

*   The code implements a specific method for interpolating between text embeddings as described in the RichSpace paper.
*   It carefully maintains tensor shapes to ensure compatibility with HunyuanVideo's architecture, especially its 3D attention mechanism and prompt embedding formatting expectations.
*   It's designed to be used within the ComfyUI framework.
*   Device management and mixed-precision computation are handled to optimize performance.
*   A potential area for improvement might be to clarify how the `mm` module works.
*   It would also be beneficial to have more comments explaining the higher-level goal of the RichSpace method in this context, e.g. a simple example of usage of `HyVideoRichSpaceTextEncode` might be helpful for new users.
